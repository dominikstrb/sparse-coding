# Sparse Coding

ARCHIVED... is now part of my V1Stats package

![](./trained_models/RF.png)

This is an implementation of Olshausen and Field's sparse coding paper in PyTorch. Iterative Shrinkage/Thresholding Algorithm 
(ISTA) is used to fit neuronal responses for the input. Gradients for receptive fields are calculated through PyTorhc's autograd
feature. 

## Run
```python
cd src/scripts
python train.py 
```
To see a list of available hyperparameters to change:
```python
python train.py -h
```
A checkpoint of the model is saved every 100 epochs. To plot the receptive fields:
```python
python plotting.py -e 100 # for the 100th epoch
```

## Will be added soon
* Fast-ISTA
